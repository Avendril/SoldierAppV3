# SoldierAppV3

##### To make this code work you need the following programs:

- Android Studio 3.0

- WAMP or cPanel (goDaddy)


## How to use:

##### Setting up WAMP

- First you will need to install WAMP server on your localhost machine or if you have, use a cPanel.

- Then you need to download all the files from this repo and put them into your WAMP www folder (or cPanel main folder) [link to the repo](
https://github.com/Avendril/Php-For-SoldierAppV2)

- After you put the files where the belong, you need to create a database in mySQL called "soldierapp" with a table called "users"

- users will have 10 columns ID(auto increment,primary key,unique), name, surname, email, phoneNo(unique),address1,address2,rank,username(unique) and password.

- After you setup the database you should be able to use the app on your emulator if you used localhost or anywhere if you used cPanel hosting (goDaddy for example).


##### Setting up Android Studio 3.0

- Just put the package from here into the workplace of your Android studio and it should be fine.

- Just a note, I was using Pixel 2 running android 8 for my emulator, the UI might look slightly different on your emulator.
